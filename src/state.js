/**
 * Centralized runtime state for Tesla Replay.
 *
 * Goal: gradually migrate global variables in `script.js` into this single object,
 * so behavior is easier to reason about and transitions (single/multi/collection)
 * don't "poison" playback state.
 *
 * We intentionally start small: only cross-cutting state that affects many parts
 * of the app is migrated first (collection mode, event popout, multi focus, scrubbing).
 *
 * This file is designed to be extended over time:
 * - move mp4/frames/decoder into `state.player`
 * - move clipGroups/index into `state.library`
 * - move preview pipeline into `state.previews`
